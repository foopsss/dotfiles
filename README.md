# Dotfiles
This is a repository I created to store the configuration files of the software I use. This branch stores my dotfiles for Gentoo, the Linux distro I'm currently using. There's another branch where I store my Fedora dotfiles, the distro I previously used.

The script I use to backup all of my dotfiles is located on my [Scripts](https://github.com/foopsss/Scripts/blob/main/Backups/Bash/Dotcopy.sh) repo, where the [credits](https://github.com/foopsss/Scripts/blob/main/CREDITS.md) for all of them can be seen as well.
